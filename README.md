# Rotato-Mindcrack

A simple Bash script to automatically download Minecraft mods from a central location.  Works with Feed the Beast
modpack launcher.

### Instructions

- Windows users: Double-click `mindcrack.bat`.
- Mac users: Double-click `mindcrack.command` or run `mindcrack.sh` in Terminal.
- Linux users: Coming soon.

The script grabs three file lists:

* `mods_forge.txt` - a list of mods to be placed in the main Forge directory
* `mods_jar.txt` - a list of JAR mods
* `mods_deprecated.txt` - a list of mods to be deleted
